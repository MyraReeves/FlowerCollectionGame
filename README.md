# 💐 Flower Collection Game 💐

This was a personal project to create a game as practice using JavaScript and CSS.

Inspiration for this project came from the ["Clicky Cat" demonstration](https://github.com/AristonCatipay/occ-webinar/tree/main/clicky-cat) given by OneCodeCamp on July 15, 2024 via [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sf-coding-bootcamp/events/301974617/).

Testing, stylistic input, and moral support given by Chris "Badger" Mackie.
