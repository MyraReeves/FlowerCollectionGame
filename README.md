# üíê Flower Collection Game üíê

This was a personal project to create a game as practice using JavaScript and CSS.

Inspiration for this project came from the ["Clicky Cat" demonstration](https://github.com/AristonCatipay/occ-webinar/tree/main/clicky-cat) presented to the public by OneCodeCamp on July 15, 2024 via [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sf-coding-bootcamp/events/301974617/).

The images used to create my game belong to the public domain.

### I would like to extend additional thanks to:

Chris "Badger" Mackie for his testing skills, stylistic input, and moral support of me being in school.

## Gameplay Instructions:

After starting the game, use your cursor and click the mouse button to collect as many flowers as you can before the timer runs out!

The more centrally located your cursor is on top of a flower, the more likely it is that you will successfully grab it when clicking the mouse button!
