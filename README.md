# üíê Flower Collection Game üíê

This was a personal project to create a game as practice using JavaScript and CSS.

Inspiration for this project came from the ["Clicky Cat" demonstration](https://github.com/AristonCatipay/occ-webinar/tree/main/clicky-cat) presented to the public by OneCodeCamp on July 15, 2024 via [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sf-coding-bootcamp/events/301974617/).

Images used to create my game belong to the public domain.

### I would like to extend additional thanks to:
